# WhichBus
_A simple, beautiful way to navigate public transit in Seattle._

Trip planning, real-time arrivals, GPS position. What more could you want?

## Why the new repository?
Well, the original WhichBus code has gotten nearly out of hand. It's big and messy and the result of much experimentation, frustration, and learning. It is now time to put all this new knowledge to use and build WhichBus right (or at least _righter_).

## What's so special about this one?
This is a new WhichBus, a lean, seafoam green, trip-planning machine. It's built on an almost entirely different set of technologies, including the following:
* **[Backbone](http://backbonejs.org)** as a frontend framework
* **[Backbone Boilerplate](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate)** as a set of best practices
* **[Backbone LayoutManager](http://layoutmanager.org)**, making views little more than configuration
* **[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)** for an immediately intuitive UI
* **[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)** for frustration-free semantic templates
* **[Require.js](http://requirejs.org/)** for brilliant module loading
* **[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)** so we don't have to write all that CSS
* **[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)** as an excellent build environment and server
